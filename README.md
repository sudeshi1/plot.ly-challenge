# plot.ly-challenge - Belly Button Biodiversity

## Background

In this, we will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Diversity Dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
